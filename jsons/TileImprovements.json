These segments were connected to defend against northern enemies. \nWith the rise of the Han dynasty in 202 BCE, diplomatic negotiations with the nomadic Xiongnu in the north soon erupted into war. In response, the Han strengthened and expanded the Qin walls, leveraging them as offensive structures to great success. Dotted with towers and forts, these walls created positions of strength in contested territories, claiming land and providing a defended route for supplies, communication, and trade.

The location was further reinforced and buildings erected to house soldiers and provisions. Smaller fortresses were often designed to be hidden from passing eyes, to allow for covert surveillance or surprise attack – one of many ways in which the Bulgars leveraged the land against their foes. \nNot many of these hidden fortresses remain today, but the most remarkable is the one at Belogradchik. It was first fortified during the Roman era and was reinforced and expanded several times, by the Byzantines, the Bulgars, and finally the Ottomans; it was a particularly important site for an offshoot Bulgarian state centered in Vidin.
